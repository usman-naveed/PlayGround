This repo is meant to be used as a reference for common coding questions. It also holds some of the data structures I have
created for practice + coding problem soltuions from HackerRank, Leetcode, project-euler
(NOTE: Definitely NOT the fastest implementations out there! The solutions posted are my first correct answer on the problem. If you happen to be here and reading this, you might as well contribute by optimizing ;)  )


Would highly recommend to search the problem on the appropriate platform and attempt it before checking out my solution
