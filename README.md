This repo is meant to be used as a reference for common coding questions. It also holds some of the data structurs I have
created just as practice

It holds some of the solutions I came up with while solving algo/coding problems. 
(NOTE: some of these are not the best/fastest soltuions! If you see a way to optimize pleae feel free to contribute)

Questions from HackerRank, LeetCode, and project-euler

I would suggest to try the problem yourself before looking at my solution.
